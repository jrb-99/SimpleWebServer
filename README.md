🌐 WELCOME TO MY SIMPLE WEB SERVER!

At the 6th week of my 14-Week Intensive Full Stack Programming Bootcamp at Code For All_, Code Cadets were challanged to build a simple web server that could
respond to HTTP requests from a client (Browsers) and provide the requested resource in the URL 🚀🌐

In order to complete this task, we used our freshly aquired knowledge of networking, how browsers and servers handle requests and responses, Java sockets,
and Java concurrent programming 🤖🔧 (I decided to use a cached thread pool to handle each client connected to the server) 

To put this Simple Web Server to the test, ensure it's running, then navigate to your browser and connect to the IP of the hosting machine,
followed by a colon (":"), the port number, a forward slash ("/"), and the desired resource name. For example: "localhost:8090/index.html."

My simple web server provides the following resources:

- /test.txt
- /index.html
- /doubleM (A Rick Ross image)
- /uncleSnoop (A Snoop Dogg image)
- /favicon.ico
- If the required resource doesn't exist, the server should respond with an error: 404
